# AutomatedAttendanceSystemBasedOnFacialRecognition
 In this project we have implemented the automated attendance system using MATLAB. We have projected our ideas to implement “automated attendance system based on facial recognition”, in which it imbibes large applications. The application includes face identification, which saves time and eliminates chances of proxy attendance because of the face authorization. Hence, this system can be implemented in a field where attendance plays an important role.  The system is designed using MATLAB platform. The proposed system uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm which is based on Eigen face approach. This algorithm compares the test image and training image and determines students who are present and absent.
